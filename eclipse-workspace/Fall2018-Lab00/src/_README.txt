To run here in Eclipse:
  - double-click to go into the nl.elridge.sudoku.view package
  - double-click Sudoku.java to open it here 
  - click on the "play" button above to run it

After you have confirmed that it launches:
  - right-click on the project name (Fall2018-Lab00)
  - from the context menu, select "Submit Project" 
  
  
After the project has been submitted, wait a minute or so and then
visit http://submit.cs.umd.edu/fall2018 to check the results of the
public test, and to also use a release token to see the results of 
the release tests.

Once you have done that, you can either help a fellow student if 
any are looking for help, or may play the Sudoku game and think 
about the rules you are using as you play, or how a program could
look at a user's answers and check whether or not they are valid.
